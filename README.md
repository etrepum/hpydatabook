Slowly working through [Python for Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793?tag=etrepum-20), but writing equivalent-ish code in Haskell instead of using pandas.

End goal is Haskell practice, and perhaps to piece together some pandas-like
tools for exploratory data analysis with Haskell.
